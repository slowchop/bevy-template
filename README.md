# Slowchop Studio's Bevy Template

This is a template for a [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) game.

## How to use

1. Install [cargo-generate](https://github.com/cargo-generate/cargo-generate#installation)
2. Run `cargo generate slowchop/bevy-template`
3. Hop into the new directory and run the project. Don't forget to use dynamic_linking for faster compile times.
